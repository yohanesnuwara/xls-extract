Intro:

When I work in Whitson AS, I had the priviledge of working with the Legend of petroleum enginering, Prof. Curtis Hays Whitson (founder of the company). One day, after showing him the result of my OCR model for PDF PVT reports, he assigned me another task of doing OCR (automated extraction) on Excel PVT reports. We need to explore a generic model that can work for all types of Excel, which are simply non-existent, even with the age of AI nowadays. 

Note: PVT reports consists of report about molecular composition of hydrocarbons sampled after drilling and the experiments that are done on samples.
